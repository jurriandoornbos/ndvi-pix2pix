Code for workshop paper: Fake it till you make it: generating NDVI from RGB UAV imagery in viticulture.

Model weights can be found [here](https://e.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=kZyTwWZGhaoeY4npaV2Nqv4xSPQl5Ljww57).

The notebooks should be able to guide one through the process of generating their own NDVI maps from RGB orthomosaics. 
Additional documentation will be made available later.
